## Development Guidelines

### Code Organization Principles

1. **Modular Design**
   - Break down functionality into logical, self-contained modules
   - Each module should have a clear, single responsibility
   - Keep related features together while maintaining separation of concerns

2. **File Structure**
   - Organize code into meaningful directories based on functionality
   - Separate core generation logic from UI components
   - Keep utility functions and shared resources in dedicated locations

3. **Balance in Code Organization**
   - Avoid monolithic single-file solutions
   - Don't over-segment code into too many small files
   - Find the right balance between modularity and maintainability

4. **Future-Proofing**
   - Design with extensibility in mind
   - Make it easy to add new features without major refactoring
   - Keep interfaces between modules clean and well-defined
